{"heading":"Budget 2024 reforms:","body":"The 2024 Union Budget has introduced noteworthy changes to capital gains taxation, signalling a significant recalibration for High-Net-Worth Individuals (HNIs) in their investment approach. As an observer of market trends, I can assert that while these reforms aren't seismic, they are far from trivial. These changes reflect a broader shift in India's economic policy, aiming to streamline the tax structure and promote more efficient capital allocation.\r\n\r\nThe government's push towards tax harmonisation across asset classes is a calculated move that reshapes the investment landscape. HNIs can now explore avenues such as private equity and venture capital funds, pre-IPO investments, angel network investments, and direct stakes in promising unlisted companies, all on a more level-tax playing field.\r\n\r\nLet's delve into these reforms and explore how they might reshape investment decisions in the coming years, uncovering both the challenges and the hidden opportunities they present.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of these reforms lies a push towards simplification in the treatment of investment returns. The uniformity in determining Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) and Short-Term Capital Gains (STCG) for both listed and unlisted asset classes and related taxation changes necessitates a thorough review of investment portfolios. This isn't just about tweaking allocations; it's about optimising asset distribution, leveraging newly tax-efficient investment avenues, and ensuring alignment with overarching financial goals.","password":"anish"}
{"heading":"Digantara: Building a Google Maps for space","body":"The founders of Digantara Research and Technologies describe their venture as a “space situational awareness” company. Anirudh Sharma and Rahul Rawat started tinkering with the idea for it while they were still in college, in Punjab, in 2018, having learnt of a satellite club their friend Tanveer Ahmed was running in Bengaluru.\r\n\r\nThe trio got into it in real earnest from 2020, having graduated with degrees in engineering, and with incubation and grant support from the IISc. Today, Digantara is evolving into a provider of an important infrastructure layer to not only commercial space economy customers, but also for India’s strategic and defence purposes.\r\n\r\n“There are over 11,000 active satellites in orbit, and that number will only increase,” says Sharma, the CEO. “We need a mechanism to navigate an orbit and understand what’s happening. Think of what we’re building as Google Maps for space.”\r\n\r\nThe significance of the work being done by companies such as Digantara is that, in aviation or in maritime navigation, there are internationally recognised rules and organisations. “We don’t have something similar in space,” Sharma adds. Today’s geopolitics makes the prospect of such an accord distant.\r\n\r\nIn addition to “situational awareness”, Digantara is also developing technologies for a more ambitious objective—“space domain awareness”. This entails understanding of what’s going on in space not just from a local perspective, but everything that’s happening in the orbit, he says.","password":"anish"}
